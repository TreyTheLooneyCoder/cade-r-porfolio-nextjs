          I&apos;ve always loved deep and intricately weaved storytelling. I&apos;ve been a gamer nearly my whole life, and reading has always been another passion of mine as well. Game development always felt like the natural carrer choice, but I never thought I&apos;d get the opportunity to code professionally.
        </p>
        <p className="text-blue-100 mb-4">
          After 9 months at CodeStack Academy, I&apos;ve developed a strong foundation in web development, design, and several programming languages. More importantly, I&apos;ve been taught how to adapt quickly to new tools and code languages themselves, and how to think like a real developer.
        </p>
        <p className="text-blue-100 mb-4">
          I often understand code better through gameplay analogies, mapping methods and logic to mechanics and systems. This mindset helps me quickly conceptualize the code structure and how to implement it elsewhere later.
        </p>
        <p className="text-blue-300">
        I&apos;m currently working on projects that combine my love for worldbuilding and storytelling with Pd(Permadeath) Player-Built lore-base narratives, exploring C# game logic, and scripting dynamic gameplay systems in Lua. My goal is to later when I&apos;ve gained more mastery in my craft, build unforgettable game worlds filled with meaning, player based lore, and plot based off of stories I create.
